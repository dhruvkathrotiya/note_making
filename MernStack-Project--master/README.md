# How to run the code

1)Download the zip file

2)It has one folder named "backend" which deals with database connectivity , in that folder install node module and all the necessary packages mentioned in its package.json file

3)Except the backend folder ,whatever you see is the front end files (forget to keep it in a single folder :-<) there also you have to install the node modules and necessary packages mentioned in the outside package.json file

4)For smooth execution:

   Open two terminals
   
   a) go to your backend directory and give the below command 
   
      npm run dev --> this will start connecting to your mongoose database

   b) remain outside of backend folder and give the below command
   
      npm run start --> this will start your server
      
5) Check if all the connections are working fine, you're good to go!
